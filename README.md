## How to Run
Download [DesktopPet.exe](https://github.com/eamonduffy/Desktop-Pet/blob/main/dist/DesktopPet.exe) and run this executable. 

## How to Terminate
Since I built this program to not show the terminal while running, you'll have to open the task manager and close the program manually from there. The process to end is called `DesktopPet.exe`.

## How to Build Project
Using pyinstaller, run `pyinstaller DesktopPet.spec` in your terminal. Should rebuild the executable with whatever changes you made.
